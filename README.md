# Experiment-9
## Program 1
## Aim
Take number of rows, columns and elements from user and display it in the form of matrix.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
A two-dimensional array, or 2D array for short, is a type of data structure that arranges data in rows and columns, much like a table. Representing matrices, tables, or grids is made easy using this structure since it makes tabular data retrieval and storage efficient. Using a notation like {array[2][3]}, for example, you can access the element at row 2 and column 3 in a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns. In many applications, such as image processing, where the color values of each pixel can be displayed in a grid, this arrangement is especially helpful.

## Conclusion
We learned how to input and output multidimensional array.

## Program 2
## Aim
Take two matrices from user and perform addition and multiplication.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
A basic operation in mathematics is matrix addition, which is the summation of the corresponding elements of two matrices of the same dimensions. To create a new matrix with the same dimensions, align each element in the first matrix with its corresponding member in the second matrix, then compute their total. This process is known as matrix addition. To obtain each element in the output matrix, for instance, if you have two 3x3 matrices, you add the elements from the two input matrices that are in the same position. The process of multiplying two matrices to create a new matrix is known as matrix multiplication, although it needs a certain alignment of the dimensions. The number of rows in the second matrix and the number of columns in the first matrix must match in order to multiply two matrices. The number of rows in the resultant matrix and the number of columns in the second matrix match the dimensions of the original matrix. The dot product of the matching row from the first matrix and the column from the second matrix is used to calculate each element in the final matrix. To do this, multiply every pair of elements, then add up the results. In many domains, including linear algebra, computer graphics, and physics simulations, matrix multiplication is an essential function.
